## 📌 About the Project

This repository includes both:
- A **fully functional DCF valuation model** of NVIDIA (Excel), and
- An **attached Equity Research Report (PDF)** covering qualitative and quantitative insights on the company.

The DCF model estimates NVIDIA’s intrinsic value using projected free cash flows, peer comparison, and assumptions based on market data. The accompanying Equity Research Report includes:
- Company Overview and Market Positioning
- Shareholding Pattern
- Peer Comparison (P/E, EV/EBITDA, ROE)
- Stock Price Action and Historical Performance
- Key Charts, Pie Diagrams, and Visual Commentary

Together, they simulate a real-world investment research framework used by equity analysts and institutional investors.
